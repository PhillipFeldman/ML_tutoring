reinforcement learning

ground truth is environment based
board games/ alphaGo/ tic tac toe/
q learning

reward/penalty, environment feedback but no dataset
dynamic data generation guiding feedback
"life" vs board games.
stochastic vs deterministic
agent based 

policy C reward ---

stochastic n arm bandit not optimization

take best action, but is it a local optimum, or global

NIM
3 players:
1)Random
2)Guru
3)Q Learner

Play games, get results, explore, optimize.
